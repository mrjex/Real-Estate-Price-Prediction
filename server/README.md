# Server


- server.py --> Single responsibility of controlling the routing, requests and responses

- util.py   --> Single responsibility of dealing with backend functionality


- This improves the code's readability as well as modularity and adheres to the 5 SOLID principles of programming, which I learned in my first course at University [Link to my OOP course directory here]
